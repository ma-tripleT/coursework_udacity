Coursework from some Udacity courses I've been taking

## Nanodegree Programs

I've started two Nanodegree programs, listed below.

### Programming for Data Science with Python

This course [nanodegree 104](https://www.udacity.com/course/programming-for-data-science-nanodegree--nd104) is an extension of the Intro to Python Programming I took over summer and includes four main modules:

* SQL
* Command Line
* Python
* Version Control (git)

I've submitted three projects which are in this repo.

#### SQL

The file `queries.sql` is my work for the SQL project and feature some queries for the ficticious DVD rental business.

#### Python

This project looks at statistics from incomplete data of a bikeshare program in Chicago, NYC & Washington DC. The user interface is a terminal prompt all contained in `bikeshare_2.py`.

To run this project from the terminal: 

```python
python bikeshare_2.py
```

and you will be prompted three times for:

1. A city - either "Chicago", "New York City" or "Washington"
2. A month - either the Gregorian month or "all"
3. Day of the week - any of the days or "all"

The input is case insensitive, so you can type "WaSHinGTon" or any combination. If you enter a word that is not on the accepted list, you'll be prompted to re-enter until a valid input is provided. 

#### Version Control

Part of the project is to create and update a github repo, which has been done whilst branching off the master to fill out this documentation.

## AI Programming with Python Nanodegree

A further course I'm taking is [nanodegree089](https://www.udacity.com/course/ai-programming-python-nanodegree--nd089) as another extension of the previous with more work in Matplotlib, PyTorch, and some Calculus & Linear Algebra.
